1. Get me the IP address of a particular domain (guvi.in). How do I find my **CPU/Memory** usage of my server?. Test the connectivity between 2 nodes?

2. I have deployed an application in **guvi.com:9000**, and logs show my app is running, but I’m unable to view the page. Check whether my port is open or not?
